Causal inference, seems complicated.
stats, etc.

but there is a very simple view, accessible if you remember high school calculus. Causal inference is partial differentiation, while observational is full differentiation

see backdoor here. 

see iv here. 

related to the structural equations model.
also resolves the dilemma with physics. if you do observe everything and the error term is negligible, then you are fine. with differentiation..only matters if error big.
