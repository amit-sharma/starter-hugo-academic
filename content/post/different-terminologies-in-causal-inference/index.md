Inspired by Larry Lessig stats ml list
this helped me a lot

so I thought of creating it. For instance, consider mendelian randomization and iv. So many years to figure out.

Here is a list:
Social sciences and biomedicine/life sciences
cause: treatment, 
covariates: confounders
instrument: causal anchor

backdoor:
potential outcome: 

And then Pearl and Rubin
Y(1) --> Y_x etc.
