abstract = "Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has a significant history of working alongside communities to identify, address, and design for specific needs and desires. However, in this position paper, we argue that we can and should go beyond participatory research in prioritizing in-action impact . We draw from our experience in studying political activism and mental health to propose a concrete discussion of possible research methods that pose an immediate benefit to the populations we work with."
